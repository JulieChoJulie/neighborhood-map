# Neighborhood Map
>This is a single page application featuring a map of Canada for planning your trip using ```knockout.js```, ```Google Map API```, ```google Place API```, and ```OpenWeatherMap API```. This app has functionality including 
    - highlighted locations
    - calculation of the shortest routes for your trip
    - weathers for cities using third-party data about those locations
    - various ways to browse the content




## Purpose of this project
>I learned how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. I also explored how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, I implemented third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that improved the quality of this application.
